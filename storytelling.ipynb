In this project, my main goal is to investigate whether Galatasaray deserved to be champions statistically or if they won the championship by defying the statistics. For this project, I will use https://theanalyst.com and https://fbref.com as sources.\n\nWhile examining the data, if I find something more interesting or different, I will add it to this project as well. If you want to check one of the topics I researched, I will list my topics here as a content section. Please remember that I'm doing these kinds of projects for fun and to learn Python. I'm trying to become a data analyst, and while learning these languages and research methods, I mostly use my hobbies as research topics, and football (soccer) is one of my hobbies. Lastly, even though football is one of my hobbies, I have a scouting certificate from IPSO, and I watch games not just by following the ball. Analyzing and thinking about \"what is this team manager's tactic, players' abilities/weaknesses\" and writing it down in my notebook has been my pleasure since I was a child, and I believe that I can use that skill more effectively using numbers and data.

He specifically highlights how this strategy played a crucial role in the success of Pep Guardiola's teams at Barcelona and Manchester City.\n\n### Teams and Coaches Utilizing Zone Control Strategy\n\n**Pep Guardiola:** Pep Guardiola's teams, particularly Barcelona and Manchester City, are renowned for their zone control and positional play strategies.\n- Guardiola's Quote:\n\"The space, you have to think about the space. Every time we lose the ball, we have to think about how we can regain the space, and every time we have the ball, we have to think about how we can occupy the space.\"\n\n**Jürgen Klopp:** Jürgen Klopp's \"gegenpressing\" strategy also heavily focuses on zone control. He has successfully implemented this strategy at Liverpool.\n- Klopp's Quote:\n\"It's all about finding the right spaces at the right moment. When we lose the ball, we have to win it back immediately, and when we have it, we need to be in the best positions to exploit the space.\"\n\n**Mauricio Pochettino:** Mauricio Pochettino has adopted zone control and pressing play at both Tottenham Hotspur and Paris Saint-Germain.\n- Pochettino's Quote:\n\"We need to dominate the spaces on the pitch. Our aim is to control the game by controlling the space and being aggressive in our positioning.\"\n\n_**The Impact of Zone Control and Areas**_\nZone control revolves around players positioning themselves in specific areas to block the opponent's passing lanes, fill empty spaces, and use these areas most efficiently when in possession. Dividing the field into 30 zones helps clarify each player's duties and responsibilities, enhancing the team's defensive and offensive effectiveness.\n\nThis strategy ensures the team remains compact, maintains distances between lines, and can quickly position themselves during transitions. This makes it difficult for the opposing team to build their play and facilitates quick ball recovery in case of loss.\n\n_**Example Areas and Roles**_\n1. Defensive Triangles: Defensive triangles formed on the backline allow players to support each other and counteract opposing attacks.\n2. Midfield Region: Midfield players position themselves in specific areas to maintain possession and recover the ball, making it difficult for the opponent to build play.\n3. Attacking Channels: Attacking players position themselves in certain channels to maintain width and stretch the opposing defense, creating empty spaces.\n\n_**Implementation and Analysis**_\n\nTo understand and implement zone control strategies, teams use video analyses, training sessions, and in-game positional data. These data help optimize how players should move on the field, which areas to focus on, and the overall tactical structure of the team.\n\nThis information provides a valuable guide to understanding how modern football tactics have evolved and how successful teams control the field.\n\nSo let's check if zone control stats affected the Turkish Super Lig standings at the end of the 23/24 season or not.","metadata":{},"id":"8264a2f9-8dd6-4996-96fd-3799695666a8","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"As stated in the description section of _Figure 1_, the blue areas indicate where teams have 55% or more control of the ball, while the red areas represent where the opponent has more than 55% control. Based on this, we might expect that Fenerbahçe and Galatasaray finished at the top of the table, while Sivasspor might have finished at the bottom. Let's count the blue, grey, and red zones by team. (Note: the boxes are not of equal sizes, but I will count them as if they are.)\n\n![zone_dis_by_team](Plots/zone_dis_by_team.png)\n\nThis is the distribution of the zones by team. After sorting them with blue zones first and grey zones second, we get this final result. So, is the count of the zones important for the end-of-season standings?\n\n## _Figure 3:_ Zone colors and W/D/L/PTS correlation heatmap\n![correlation matrix](Plots/correlation%20matrix.png)\n\nBefore interpreting this correlation heatmap, we need to understand the types of correlation:\n- Strong Correlation: If the correlation coefficient (r) is between -1 and -0.7, or between 0.7 and 1, the correlation is considered strong.\n- Moderate Correlation: If the correlation coefficient is between -0.7 and -0.3, or between 0.3 and 0.7, the correlation is considered moderate.\n- Weak Correlation: If the correlation coefficient is between -0.3 and 0.3, the correlation is considered weak or close to zero.\n\nLet's examine our heatmap in light of this information.\n\nAs we can see from the correlation heatmap, there are some strong correlations that support this idea:\n- Pts (total points) and Blues = 0.71\n- W (win) and Blues = 0.71\n- L (lose) and Blues = -0.66\n\n- Pts (total points) and Greys = 0.1\n- W (win) and Greys = 0.1\n- L (lose) and Greys = -0.09\n\n- Pts (total points) and Reds = -0.64\n- W (win) and Reds = -0.63\n- L (lose) and Reds = 0.59\n\nBoth Blues and Reds have a moderate correlation with D (draw), which is not strong. While Blues have a negative correlation, Reds have a positive one. This means that having red zones does not strongly affect D (draw) but has a moderate effect.\n\nOn the other hand, Blues have a strong correlation with W (win) and Pts (total points). Reds do not have a strong correlation according to the defined correlation method, but they are very close to the strong correlation category with L (lose) and Pts (total points).\n\nSo, how does this correlation affect team standings?\nIf we say teams need to finish within +/- 4 positions of their end-of-season standings based on their number of blue zones, what are the odds that teams finished within this range?\nI checked this with different ranges, but I believe a +/- 4 range is fair enough.\nAs a percentage:\n- Are the teams within the +/- 3 range between zone ranking and standings?\n  - False: 0.55\n  - True: 0.45\n\n- Are the teams within the +/- 4 range between zone ranking and standings?\n  - True: 0.6\n  - False: 0.4\n\n- Are the teams within the +/- 5 range between zone ranking and standings?\n  - True: 0.6\n  - False: 0.4\n  (It is the same as +/- 4, so that means there is no team with a 5-position gap.)\n\nBut as I said, I want to use +/- 4 for this project. As a visualization, here is the distribution of teams regarding whether they finished within 4 positions of their zone control ranking.\n\n## _Figure 4:_  Distribution of teams by their +/- 4 ranks of zone colors\n![distribution of range](Plots/distribution%20of%20range.png)\n\nA 0.6 correlation is not considered a strong correlation, but it is very close. Of course, there are many different tactics, exceptions, game-changing players, fans, etc. But either way, regarding our search, Galatasaray, Fenerbahçe, and Beşiktaş at the top and Samsunspor, Konyaspor, and Hatayspor at the bottom are great examples of this.\n\nHowever, Kayserispor is at the top of the zone table but finished the season in the middle of the table. On the other hand, Sivasspor is the last team in the zone ranking table but finished 7th. This basically means that some teams play directly/counter-attack instead of having the ball in most of the zones. Those kinds of tactical differences can't be understood from this table. For that, we need to read other tables.\n\nWe got great information from this table. And now, let's check another table about zone control which is more detailed.\n\n## _Figure 5:_ Bivariate zones of control map\n![Bivariate Zone Control](Plots/Bivariate%20Zone%20Control.png)","metadata":{},"id":"96a9e4de-7364-48dc-9a94-79533915910e","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"As you can see from the description, pink zones are where the team has more control than the opposition, green zones are the opposite, where the opposition has more control than the team, and lastly, grey zones are where the team has high traffic.\nIn this analysis, we need to focus especially on offensive zones, which are colored pink and grey. Having a pink zone in the defensive zone does not mean anything. Green zones, which are the opposition's defensive zones, are the same because those zones HAVE to be that way. However, if I see something unusual compared to what I expected (like green zones in the team's defensive zones), I'm going to investigate that point as a different topic. For now, I'm more interested in the total grey zones and offensive pink zones.\nFor a start, let's check Galatasaray and Fenerbahçe's zones.\n\n# 2. Comparison of Galatasaray's and Fenerbahçe's bivariate zone control statistics.\n\n## _Figure 6:_ Bivariate zones of control map of Galatasaray and Fenerbahçe's\n![FBGS](Plots/FBGS.png)","metadata":{},"id":"8c805d61-dffe-4e09-8e18-ae43f828049c","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"They almost have the same zone colors on the field. Let's check from the first column of the field zone by zone (split the field into 6 columns and 5 rows).\n\na. _**DEFENSE ZONE**_\n- The first column is the same for both teams.\n- In the second column, while Fenerbahçe has 3 pink zones in the middle, Galatasaray has one white-near zone. But more importantly, in the first and last rows of this column, Fenerbahçe looks more defensive because the greens are more whitish.\n- In the third column, Galatasaray has one more zone in the middle which is colored pink. That might be very effective for having the ball as a percentage.\n\nBefore looking at the other half, we need to expect in light of this information that Galatasaray has been conceded more goals. Because their second column does not seem so strong, but on the other hand, their third-mid is more pink than Fenerbahçe. But at the end of the season, Galatasaray scored 92 and conceded 26 goals. Fenerbahçe scored 99 and conceded 31 goals. So statistically, my inference is not correct. Is it? Let's check that by using other stats.\n\n![FBGSstats](Plots/FBGSstats.png)\n\n`I merged necessary columns which I got from FBREF.com [notebook.ipynb](For Glossary)`\n\nHere, I merged defensive columns to look at.\nAt the top, my inference was Galatasaray needed to concede more goals than Fenerbahçe because of zone colors. But when we checked basic stats like teams' scored or conceded goal numbers, my inference looks wrong.\nBut when I checked other tables which have more details, my inferences look not wrong. As a result, yes, Galatasaray conceded fewer goals. But is that proof that I'm wrong or are there different situations which affected these stats like goalkeeper's abilities? Because my other type of inference is Galatasaray gives oppositions more positions than Fenerbahçe in light of these zone colors even they conceded less goals.\n\n1. First of all again, Galatasaray scored 92, conceded 26.\nFenerbahce scored 99, conceded 31.\n\nBut;\n\n2. Galatasaray made 428 fouls, Fenerbahçe made 525.\nThat means, Fenerbahçe gives their opposition more free-kick chances than Galatasaray. That might be one of the reasons for the +5 conceded goals for Fenerbahçe. So let's check that.\n\n![expected_goals](Plots/expected_goals.png)\n\n- Galatasaray's defensive XG Ratio (expected goals per game) from open plays is 0.24. But more importantly, Galatasaray faced 282 shots in open play with a total XG of 20.8 for the season but conceded only 14. Also Galatasaray faced 106 set play shots (free kicks etc.) and their defensive set play XG is 7.46, but they conceded 9. Almost 2 more than expected.\n \nTo understand the +5 goal difference for Fenerbahçe and Galatasaray, I thought it might be because of Fenerbahçe's high number of fouls. Which isn't!\n\nBecause Fenerbahçe's XG Ratio (expected goals per game) is 0.21 (less than Galatasaray) and also in open play they faced 201 shots! (Much less than Galatasaray again). But there is a trick. While Fenerbahçe's defensive XG in total from open play is 16.91 for the season, they conceded 21, which is more than expected. But as a reminder, Galatasaray conceded almost 7 goals less than their total defensive XG at the end of the season!\n\nAnd again about my inference, Fenerbahçe faced 95 shots from set plays while their SP XG is 5.38, they conceded 5, which is so close to expected.\n\nAs a result, the number of fouls does not mean that Fenerbahçe conceded more goals from set plays because of their foul numbers. And actually, it's more the opposite!\nAs we can see from the numbers, while Fenerbahçe seems statistically better than Galatasaray, they conceded more goals! They faced fewer shots, less XG in open play and set plays, but while they have 16.91 open play XG, they conceded 21. So it pops up one thing in my head, goalkeeper abilities.\n\n3. I believe that stats are enough to see that there is a big goalkeeper difference between these two teams. But again, to be sure about that, let's continue to check other stats.\n- While Galatasaray's GA90 (Goals Against/90) is 0.68, Fenerbahçe's is 0.82. \n- Galatasaray's SoTA (Shots on Target Against) is 115, Fenerbahçe's is 97. \n- Galatasaray's saves 92, Fenerbahçe's 70.\n- Galatasaray's save percent is 79.1, Fenerbahçe's 73.2.\n- Galatasaray's CS% (Clean Sheet Percentage) is 47.4, Fenerbahçe's is 44.7. (As total CS, Galatasaray has 18, Fenerbahçe 17 almost the same)\n\n## _Figure 7:_ Galatasaray / Fenerbahçe stats comperation barplot\n![GSFB_Def_Stats_Bar](Plots/GSFB_Def_Stats_Bar.png)\n\nI didn't include PKatt (Penalty Kicks Attempted) but as a note, Fenerbahçe conceded 5 penalty attempts and none of them were saved by the goalkeeper or missed.\n\nAnd about this graph, Fenerbahçe's percentage is higher than Galatasaray's only GA90 (Goals Against/90) and that because they conceded more goals than Galatasaray as total (didn't put that to graph, it wan't seems clearly because both has low pertentage). But in any other stats in the graph, it is so clear that Galatasaray gives their oppositions more positions than Fenerbahçe staticly.","metadata":{},"id":"087aa9c8-4f45-444a-8e87-00f3fdb67553","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"All teams defensive correlation heatmap.\n\n## _Figure 8:_ Defensive stats correlation heatmap\n![def_allteams_corr_map](Plots/def_allteams_corr_map.png)\n\nAs the heatmap shows, almost everything affects points (pts) as expected. Notably, set play shots (SP SHOTS) have a strong negative correlation of -0.60 with points. This means that set plays are not much less important than open play. However, there is a little trick. While SP SHOTS have a stronger correlation with points, SP XG has a much weaker correlation, almost half that of SP SHOTS and points. This might be due to the following reasons:\n\n**Efficiency and Quality Differences:** \n\nTeams may take set play shots that don’t necessarily create high-quality chances, leading to a lower XG. However, teams that generate a high volume of set play shots may be more successful in creating opportunities, which translates to a higher number of goals and thus, a stronger direct impact on their season-end points.\n\n**Importance of Shot Volume:** \n\nIn football data, the conversion rate of XG into actual goals may not always reflect the true potential. Some teams might have lower shot efficiency, but the sheer volume of shots indicates that they are putting more pressure on their opponents and creating more scoring opportunities. Therefore, the total number of shots (SP SHOTS) might show a higher correlation with points than XG.\n\n**Specific Strategies and Circumstances:** \n\nCertain teams might focus on set pieces as a strategy, not necessarily aiming to maximize XG but to constantly threaten the opponent’s defense. These teams might use shots as a way to maintain pressure rather than just score goals, leading to a situation where shot volume has a higher correlation with points than XG.\n\nIn summary, a team that takes a high number of set play shots could be frequently creating danger, which contributes more significantly to their season-end points. This is why SP SHOTS might have a higher correlation with points than SP XG, which makes logical sense.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"84f01dc1-9c76-4cf2-a918-991fab136528"},{"source":"But other question is, is there any team at top 7 has a more bad stats like Galatasaray, or is Galatasaray the worst.\n\n## _Figure 9:_ Top 7 team's defensive stats barplot\n![Defensive_Statistics_by_Squad top_7](Plots/Defensive_Statistics_by_Squad%20top_7.png)\n\n## _Figure 10:_ Top 7 teams's defensive stats lineplot\n![top_seven_line_plot](Plots/top_seven_line_plot.png)\n\n![top_seven_table](Plots/top_seven_table.png)\n\nHere are the defensive stats and rankings of the top seven teams. Before analyzing this data, we need to consider a couple of things:\n- Some stats, especially those related to goalkeepers, might be high due to the poor defensive performance of their teams. If a goalkeeper makes more saves than any other goalkeeper, it doesn't necessarily mean he is the best in the league. It could be due to the defensive weaknesses of his team. Therefore, while comparing stats, keep in mind the differences in team quality.\n- Secondly, all of these stats are defensive stats. SP XG, Shots, or XG are defensive metrics, not offensive ones.\n- Lastly, while ranking teams by the top 7, season standings and rankings need to be opposite to be accurate. At least, we need to expect that. For example, after ranking teams by their defensive stats among the top 7, Galatasaray should be close to seventh rank among all those 7 teams. On the other hand, Sivasspor, as the seventh team in the standings, should be first in defensive stats when ranking them. Let's check them out!","metadata":{},"id":"e51659ae-644e-41ad-9408-bbf021e6daf8","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"In the table and plot, we can see that while Galatasaray is at the bottom of the rankings. Fenerbahçe shows a similar pattern. Therefore, when examining the ranking distribution, we need to focus on outliers. For instance, if we analyze team by team, Galatasaray appears to be appropriately ranked among the top 7 teams, except for the SP GOALS_Rank. They are in the second position among these 7 teams, which seems unfavorable. However, Galatasaray conceded 9 set play goals, while Fenerbahçe conceded 5, sharing the same rank with Trabzonspor. Although Galatasaray conceded 4 more goals than their rival Fenerbahçe, Kasımpaşa is ranked first with 17 conceded goals from set plays. If Kasımpaşa had been more careful with defensive set plays, their final position might have been different, which could be a topic for future analysis.\n\n**Galatasaray:**\n\n- **Shots Faced:** Galatasaray faces a relatively high number of shots compared to other teams, indicating they allow more opportunities for their opponents.\n- **Saves:** Despite facing many shots, their save percentage is competitive, showing that their goalkeeper plays a crucial role in their defensive strength.\n\n**Fenerbahçe:**\n\n- **Goals Conceded:** Fenerbahçe has a lower goal concession rate, reflecting a strong overall defensive performance.\n- **Clean Sheets (CS%):** They also maintain a good percentage of clean sheets, further supporting their solid defense.\n\n**Trabzonspor:**\n\n- **Set Piece Goals Conceded (SP GOALS):** Trabzonspor concedes fewer goals from set pieces, suggesting they are well-organized and disciplined in defending dead-ball situations.\n- **Save Percentage (Save%):** Their save percentage is quite low, indicating that their goalkeeper is not so effective as much as other top three teams.\n\n**Başakşehir:**\n\n- **Set Piece XG Conceded (SP XG):** Başakşehir seems vulnerable when defending set pieces, as indicated by their higher expected goals conceded from such situations.\n- **Saves and SoTA (Shots on Target Against):** They face a substantial number of shots on target, which may indicate a weakness in their defensive setup.\n\n**Kasımpaşa:**\n\n- **Clean Sheets and Goals Conceded:** Kasımpaşa struggles with maintaining clean sheets and has a higher goals conceded rate, pointing towards defensive vulnerabilities.\n- **Set Piece Shots Against (SP SHOTS):** They allow many shots from set pieces, which could be a critical area of concern.\n\n**Beşiktaş:**\n\n- **Shots Against (SHOTS):** Beşiktaş is one of the teams facing the most shots, suggesting that they might allow their opponents too much space or time on the ball.\n- **Saves:** However, their goalkeeper's performance helps mitigate this by making a significant number of saves.\n\n**Sivasspor:**\n\n- **Expected Goals Against (XG):** Sivasspor has a higher expected goals against, indicating that their defense allows high-quality chances for the opposition.\n- **SoTA (Shots on Target Against):** They also face a large number of shots on target, putting their goalkeeper under consistent pressure.\n\nOverall, this chart highlights the defensive strengths and weaknesses of the teams. Teams like Fenerbahçe and Galatasaray show strong defensive metrics, particularly in terms of clean sheets and save percentages, while others like Sivasspor and Kasımpaşa might need to address specific defensive issues, such as defending against set pieces or reducing the number of shots faced.\n\nSince I focused on Galatasaray and Fenerbahçe, I won't delve deeply into the other 5 teams in this table, but I don't see any significant outliers that are important for this research. Yes, Fenerbahçe looks statistically better, but Galatasaray is not far behind. If we take an average of all these rankings (excluding Save% and CS% as they would skew the average), we can get a clearer picture.","metadata":{},"id":"1ce2f377-3142-4779-8355-1bfdd1eb7862","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"![top_7_avgh_rank](Plots/top_7_avgh_rank.png)\n\nAfter calculating the average rank for each team, the results appear similar to the final standings. Among these 7 teams, Başakşehir, Kasımpaşa, and Sivasspor finished the league in the same position as their defensive stats ranking. Only Trabzonspor/Beşiktaş and Galatasaray/Fenerbahçe slightly switched positions.\nSo let's check all league teams by their average rankings and look at the results.\n\n![all_teams_avh_rank](Plots/all_teams_avg_rank.png)","metadata":{},"id":"ab04ebd6-e7ff-4fd6-bb9f-b7066555540b","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"Across the whole league, there are some outliers.

While Galatasaray conceded 282 shots, Fenerbahçe conceded 201. There is an 81-shot difference for the entire season, and considering there are 38 matches in the league, that means Galatasaray conceded 2.13 more shots per game. However, looking at these stats without including SoTA (Shots on Target Against) stats will not give us accurate results. The SoTA difference between these two teams is 18, which means Galatasaray conceded only 0.47 more shots on target per game, or roughly 1 shot on target every 2 games. So, while Galatasaray conceded more shots, they were not on target. Therefore, this big gap doesn't mean much for their defensive line.\n\nOn the other hand, Galatasaray's save and save% are greater than Fenerbahçe's, which proves that goalkeepers made a big difference.\n\nBut to better understand the difference between goalkeepers or defensive lines, we need to look at XG (Expected Goals) and conceded goals.\n- Galatasaray's defensive XG is 20, and they conceded 14.\n- Fenerbahçe's defensive XG is 16, and they conceded 21.\n\nThese stats show us that Fenerbahçe conceded 5 more goals than expected. The same thing happened to Galatasaray. While their defensive SP (Set Piece) SHOTS are 106, their SP XG is 7, and they conceded 9, which is 2 more than expected. For Fenerbahçe, their defensive SP SHOTS are less than Galatasaray's (95), their SP XG is also 5, and they conceded fewer SP GOALS (5), which is 2 less than Galatasaray.

The analysis underscores the importance of defensive performance in determining league standings, with lower rankings indicating better defensive outcomes.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis underscores the importance of strong defensive performance in achieving a high league rank. Teams with better defensive stats (lower rankings) tend to have more wins, fewer losses, and concede fewer goals, which translates to better league standings. The consistency of these findings across multiple metrics and teams provides confidence in the research methodology and the columns used for analysis. In summary, this analysis effectively demonstrates that strong defensive stats are crucial for achieving higher league standings, with most teams' final positions closely aligning with their defensive rankings.\n\nHowever, due to differences in playing style, player abilities, etc., some teams like Sivasspor finished the league as outliers, either positively or negatively. Assuming that a team with bad defensive stats will necessarily have a poor standing is not correct. They might excel in offensive statistics. Until the summary of the entire project, I don't want to make assumptions about the playing styles of certain teams. After we check other stats like offensive ones, passing stats, etc., we can discuss football and make assumptions using these kinds of statistics as a source.\n\nSo now, it's time to do the same analysis for offensive stats. First, I'm going to conduct the same research for Galatasaray and Fenerbahçe, then check the whole league's teams. Maybe we can find out why some teams are outliers and finished the league in unexpected positions. Did they score too few goals, or did top teams with bad defensive stats score more? Let's find out!","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"08d35636-5236-4b5c-a3d3-4d95b7ada85f"},{"source":"b. _**OFFENSIVE ZONE**_\n\nHere, I'm going to start analyzing offensive zones using bivariate zones, which are more detailed. Just in case, I'm going to add the graphs that I used for defensive zones before at the bottom.\n\n## _Figure 5:_ Bivariate zones of control map\n![Bivariate Zone Control](Plots/Bivariate%20Zone%20Control.png)\n\nAnd again, like I did with defensive stats, first I'm going to look at Galatasaray's and Fenerbahçe's offensive zones by eye. Then, I'm going to select the necessary columns for offensive stats. After all of those comparisons, I'll check other teams in the league using the same columns as I did before.\n\n## _Figure 6:_ Bivariate zones of control map of Galatasaray and Fenerbahçe's\n![FBGS](Plots/FBGS.png)\n\nIn this table, the green zones are almost the same. The only difference is that while Galatasaray has one more grey zone in the middle of the first column of the opposition's field, Fenerbahçe has one more grey zone in the second column of the first row of the opposition's field. So first, let's check who played at right midfield for Galatasaray and who played left winger for Fenerbahçe, and what their stats are.\n\nBecause of tactical changes game by game, we can't assume that only one player played left winger for Fenerbahçe or right midfield for Galatasaray. But at least before checking stats (I'm jumping to stats because there is nothing unusual in the tables), we need to consider two things:\nGalatasaray has powerful midfielders. But like I said, we can't say only one of them at right midfield by looking at stats or graphs. However, Tete and Barış at right wing, the players who played close to the right wing, might be effective at right-close midfield. On the other hand, Ferdi at left back and Tadic at left wing seem powerful in terms of stats and abilities. So my point is, Fenerbahçe might be effective on the right side of the opposition's field because of player abilities, but Galatasaray might be effective in midfield because of player abilities plus their game system. After researching offensive zone distributions and correlations, I'm going to check pass and ball control stats between Galatasaray and Fenerbahçe before the final result.\n\n![fb_gs_offensive_stats](Plots/fb_gs_offensive_stats.png)\n\nBefore looking at offensive stats, we need to know XG RATIO and XG difference.\n\"XG ratio\" (Expected Goals Ratio) represents the ratio of a team's total XG to the total XG produced in the matches they played. This ratio indicates how much scoring opportunity a team creates relative to the total scoring opportunities in their matches.\n\nFor example, looking at the data for Galatasaray and Fenerbahçe:\n- Galatasaray:\nXG: 52.99\nXG Ratio: 0.2\n\n- Fenerbahçe:\nXG: 66.51\nXG Ratio: 0.14\nDespite Fenerbahçe scoring more goals, their XG ratio is lower than Galatasaray's. This can be attributed to several factors:\n\n1. Denominator of XG: XG Ratio is calculated by dividing the team's total XG by the total XG produced in all the matches they played. Fenerbahçe's matches may have had a higher overall total XG, which results in a lower ratio.\n2. Opponent Performance: Fenerbahçe's opponents might have created more scoring opportunities (higher XG) in the matches Fenerbahçe played, increasing the denominator in the ratio.\n3. Defensive Performance: Fenerbahçe's defense might have allowed opponents to generate more XG, again increasing the denominator.\n\nTherefore, the reason Fenerbahçe's XG Ratio is lower despite scoring more goals is likely because the total XG in their matches is higher or their opponents have produced more XG. The XG Ratio helps us understand a team's overall offensive and defensive performance and how effective they are compared to the total scoring opportunities in their matches.","metadata":{},"id":"35ce2a14-265f-4e67-8f22-5fe932f203b6","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"Let's check other stats and read them one by one.\n\nGalatasaray's shot number is slightly higher than Fenerbahçe's, but Fenerbahçe's total XG is much higher than Galatasaray's. Statistically, Fenerbahçe's total XG is 13.52 higher than Galatasaray's. If we round this to 13, we would expect Fenerbahçe to have scored 13 more goals than Galatasaray. However, they only scored 7 more (Galatasaray scored 92, Fenerbahçe 99). This indicates that Fenerbahçe couldn't convert their chances effectively. (Note: The goals in the table are from open play, not set plays or penalty kicks.)\n\nOn the other hand, Galatasaray's set play XG is greater than Fenerbahçe's. Despite Fenerbahçe's higher overall XG, Galatasaray utilized their set play XG effectively. They had more shots from set plays, and their SP XG is 2.89 higher than Fenerbahçe's. As a result, Galatasaray scored 15 goals from set plays, while Fenerbahçe scored 13. Although Fenerbahçe's set play goals remained the same, Galatasaray's were one less. In conclusion, Galatasaray was more effective than Fenerbahçe in set plays, utilizing the 2.89 SP XG gap very well by scoring 2 more than expected from SP XG.\n\nSo before checking other stats, what do those columns mean?\n- Build-Up Attacks: The number of open play sequences that contain 10 or more passes and either end in a shot or have at least one touch in the box.\n- Direct Attacks: The number of open play sequences that start just inside the team's own half, have at least 50% of movement towards the opposition's goal, and end in a shot or a touch in the opposition box.\n- PPDA (Passes Per Defensive Action): The number of opposition passes allowed outside of the pressing team's own defensive third, divided by the number of defensive actions by the pressing team outside of their own defensive third. A lower figure indicates a higher level of pressing, while a higher figure indicates a lower level of pressing.\n- Shot Ending: The number of shot-ending sequences that start in open play and begin 40m or less from the opponent's goal.\n- Goal Ending: The number of goal-ending sequences that start in open play and begin 40m or less from the opponent's goal.\n\nBased on this, we can say Galatasaray pressed more than Fenerbahçe. Assuming that Galatasaray had more possession than Fenerbahçe wouldn't be wrong as a preliminary guess, especially since Galatasaray's PPDA is much lower than Fenerbahçe's (indicating they pressed high). In other columns like build-up attacks, direct attacks, and PPDA, Galatasaray seems better than Fenerbahçe.\n\nEven though Fenerbahçe had fewer build-up attacks, direct attacks, and a higher PPDA (which means they pressed less than Galatasaray), they were more effective than Galatasaray in the opposition's field in general. How so?\n\nIn view of those stats and information, my interest is that Galatasaray has more build-up attacks and barely more direct attacks than Fenerbahçe. But Fenerbahçe's shot ending and goal ending are much higher than Galatasaray's. That means Galatasaray is more likely focused on passing and pressing, having the ball; Fenerbahçe is more likely playing direct plays which do not depend on passing. To check my guesses, let's check passing stats between those two teams.\n\n![pass_stats_gs_fb](Plots/pass_stats_gs_fb.png)","metadata":{},"id":"2fa7a5c8-fe64-48b6-99fe-07d63d049a1e","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"In terms of stats, both teams are very close to each other. However, possession (poss) and sequence time show some small differences. (The average time (in seconds) per sequence.)\nSo what do we need to understand from only those two stats?\n- First, because of Galatasaray's sequence time, which means they had the ball 0.38 seconds more than Fenerbahçe. This basically affected the possession (poss) stats.\n- Galatasaray's possession is higher than Fenerbahçe's, and they also had more great build-up attacks. These are connected because while Galatasaray had the ball, they set up attacks more carefully. Additionally, Galatasaray had more +10 pass sequences.\n\n## _Figure 12:_ Galatasaray/Fenerbahçe offensive stats barplot\n![GSFB_Off_Stats_Bar](Plots/GSFB_Off_Stats_Bar.png)\n\nAs shown in this bar plot, there is no big difference between these two teams. But even though it's not a big gap, Galatasaray shot more than Fenerbahçe, and according to the stats, Galatasaray played with the ball more than Fenerbahçe, which affected their set play stats as I thought before.\nSo if we get a correlation heatmap to see how those stats affected points at the end of the season, what would we see?\n\n## _Figure 13:_ Offensive stats correlation heatmap\n![offensive pass corr heatmap](Plots/offensive%20pass%20corr%20heatmap.png)","metadata":{},"id":"0d42c3c7-1cc3-42f7-827e-ace178b4b852","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"If we look at the correlation between those stat categories and points (pts), PPDA, build-up attacks, and possession (poss), we see a strong or almost strong relationship.

Considering the combination of these two pieces of information, if build-up attacks have an almost strong relationship with points (0.66) and if possession and build-up attacks have a strong relationship (0.82), we can assume that having the ball patiently and planning the game is much more effective than playing fast and direct attacks. As I mentioned many sentences ago, the difference between Galatasaray and Fenerbahçe might be the pass/possession rate, which seems true.\nBut before coming to a conclusion, let's rank these stats as we did for defensive stats.","metadata":{},"id":"78895c9e-646e-4efb-94eb-aeed4b3f7442","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## _Figure 14:_ Bar plot of the top seven teams' offensive stats\n![top_seven_off_barplot](Plots/top_seven_off_barplot.png)\n\n## _Figure 15:_ Line plot of the top seven teams' offensive stats\n![top_seven_off_lineplot](Plots/top_seven_off_lineplot.png)","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"266e65b9-2d59-4082-bea6-adf6e84c5e96"},{"source":"While looking at the top seven teams as I did for defensive statistics, the line plot does not seem very clear. However, by examining the line plot categories one by one, we can gather a few insights.\n\n### Galatasaray:\n- **Shot Count**: Galatasaray stands out as the team with the most shots among the others, indicating their offensive effectiveness.\n- **SP SHOTS and SP XG**: The team has a high number of shots and expected goals (XG) from set pieces, demonstrating their threat in dead-ball situations.\n\n### Fenerbahçe:\n- **Direct Attacks**: Fenerbahçe excels in the \"Direct Attacks\" category, showing that they prefer fast, direct plays and are effective in this approach.\n- **Direct Speed**: They also have the highest value in direct attack speed, further supporting their preference for quick offensive transitions.\n\n### Trabzonspor:\n- **Build Up Attacks**: Trabzonspor is prominent in this category, indicating that they often rely on organized build-up play to create scoring opportunities.\n- **Possession**: They also rank highly in possession, suggesting a preference for controlling the ball and patiently developing their attacks.\n\n### Başakşehir:\n- **Sequence Time and Passes Per Sequence**: Başakşehir stands out for their approach of building up play with longer sequences of passes, showing a preference for a more controlled and patient offensive strategy.\n\n### Kasımpaşa:\n- **XG**: Kasımpaşa ranks high in expected goals, indicating that they generate quality scoring opportunities. However, it's essential to assess how well they convert these chances into actual goals.\n- **Direct Speed**: Their direct speed is relatively low, suggesting they prefer a slower, more methodical build-up in their attacks.\n\n### Beşiktaş:\n- **PPDA (Passes Allowed per Defensive Action)**: This statistic reflects Beşiktaş's defensive pressure and how actively they press their opponents. They rank high in this category, showing strong defensive engagement.\n- **Direct Attacks**: They are lower in direct attacks, implying a preference for more organized and less direct attacking plays.\n\n### Sivasspor:\n- **Goals**: Sivasspor lags behind in goal count compared to other teams, indicating a struggle to be effective in the final third.\n- **Build Up Attacks**: They also rank low in this category, suggesting they might prefer a more direct approach rather than building up through organized play.\n\nOverall, this chart offers valuable insights into the teams' offensive strategies and effectiveness.

However, despite their average rankings, they have fewer XG than Fenerbahçe (G: 52.99, F: 66.51), but their goals are only 6 fewer than Fenerbahçe's. This means that while Galatasaray scored more than their XG (expected goals), Fenerbahçe scored less than their XG, indicating that they couldn't effectively use their XG advantage. Besides that, Galatasaray is more effective than Fenerbahçe at set plays. While Galatasaray has 16.16 SP XG, they scored 15. On the other hand, Fenerbahçe has 13.27 SP XG and they scored 13. So while Galatasaray scored more than their SP XG, Fenerbahçe scored exactly the same as theirs.\n\nIn other categories, Galatasaray controls the ball more than Fenerbahçe (G: 61, F: 57.1). Additionally, their PPDA is greater than Fenerbahçe's (G: 7.3, F: 9.4). Obviously, because of different game styles, while Galatasaray is more effective at sequence time, 10+ pass op sequences, and build-up attacks, Fenerbahçe is more effective at shot ending and goal ending.\n\nBased on these statistics, we can imagine a team that presses high and pushes the defensive line forward for Galatasaray. They had the ball, passed more, and built attacks more carefully. Besides that, they used set plays, including corners and free kicks, more effectively, which affected their standings. It looks like Fenerbahçe couldn't use their statistical advantage in their powerful categories as effectively as Galatasaray.\n\n**Fenerbahçe:**\n\nFenerbahçe's stats are not far behind Galatasaray's. As I mentioned in Galatasaray's report, Fenerbahçe's gameplay is different from Galatasaray's. While Galatasaray wants to rule the game by having the ball and playing set plays mostly, Fenerbahçe played direct attacks and didn't control the ball as much as Galatasaray. Two different tactics affected stats in a good way, but as a result, it looks like Fenerbahçe couldn't use their positive stats to get a positive result. XG (open game XG) is an example of that. They scored (70) more than their XG (66.51) but still, they are much further behind Galatasaray. Because while Fenerbahçe scored almost +4 goals more than their XG, Galatasaray scored almost +11. And if we include Galatasaray's SP XG and SP GOALS (which are 2 more than Fenerbahçe's), I think those stats explain the standing differences.\n\nOn the other hand, penalty kicks, which I didn't use in the plots, show us my two points at the same time. While Galatasaray used 13 penalty kicks, they scored 11. But while Fenerbahçe used 17 penalty kicks, they scored 12. So as a result, Galatasaray missed 2 and Fenerbahçe missed 5. And as for defensive penalty kicks, Fenerbahçe conceded 5 of 5 penalty kicks but Galatasaray conceded 2 of 3. So my two points, which I already mentioned, are that Galatasaray made a difference with their goalkeeper and, secondly, Fenerbahçe couldn't use their offensive playing style effectively. Because having both (good goalkeeping stats and offensive stats) might look impossible, but at least according to the playing style, you need to be good at one of them. If you decide to play more offensively and fast like Fenerbahçe and if you lose the ball, that will cost you a conceded goal. So you need to use that offensive efficiency or should play more defensively and set play style like Galatasaray. While sacrificing conceding a goal, don't miss 5 penalties in a single season.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"4c53d132-d6de-4abd-ad04-1a5b0a1d47b6"},{"source":"**Overall Analysis:**\n\nWhen averaging the rankings of the top 7 teams (excluding Save% and CS%), the standings are similar to the offensive stats rankings.\nAcross the whole league, some teams are outliers, but the majority fall within a +/- 4 position range between their average offensive ranking and final standings.\nThere is a strong correlation between average rank and wins, losses, goals for, and goals against, highlighting the importance of strong offensive stats for achieving a high rank.\nIn summary, both Galatasaray and Fenerbahçe have strong offensive stats that align closely with their final league positions, with Galatasaray slightly behind Fenerbahçe in some offensive metrics. The analysis underscores the importance of offensive performance in determining league standings, with lower rankings indicating better offensive outcomes.\n\n### Ranking and Standings Alignment:\n\nThe analysis shows that the offensive rankings (where lower ranks are better) generally align with the final league standings for most teams. Teams like Galatasaray, Fenerbahçe, Başakşehir, Kasımpaşa, and Sivasspor finished the league in positions that closely match their offensive stats rankings.\n\n### Outliers:\n\nSome teams are outliers, such as Samsunspor, Konyaspor, and Fatih Karagümrük, which have strong offensive stats but finished lower in the league standings. Conversely, teams like Rizespor and Sivasspor have weaker offensive stats but finished higher in the league standings.\n\n### Correlation Analysis:\n\nThere is a strong positive correlation between average offensive rank and wins (0.69) and goals for (0.68), indicating that teams with better offensive stats tend to win more and score more goals. There is also a strong positive correlation between average offensive rank and losses (0.70), meaning teams with better offensive stats tend to lose less. A strong negative correlation exists between average offensive rank and goals against (-0.82), showing that teams with better offensive stats concede fewer goals.\n\n### Position Range Analysis:\n\nThe majority of teams fall within a +/- 4 position range between their average offensive ranking and final standings, indicating a strong alignment between offensive performance and league position. Specifically, 60% of the teams are within this range, reinforcing the reliability of using offensive stats to predict league standings.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe analysis underscores the importance of strong offensive performance in achieving a high league rank. Teams with better offensive stats (lower rankings) tend to have more wins, fewer losses, and concede fewer goals, which translates to better league standings. The consistency of these findings across multiple metrics and teams provides confidence in the research methodology and the columns used for analysis. In summary, your analysis effectively demonstrates that strong offensive stats are crucial for achieving higher league standings, with most teams' final positions closely aligning with their offensive rankings.\n\nSo now, it's time to do the same analysis for defensive stats.
